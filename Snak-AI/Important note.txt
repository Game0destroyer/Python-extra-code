You should install the requirements first, and after that, you should run agent.py


The speed is very fast when you run the agent, because the default speed is 1000

Note:
  Up arrow key    --> +100 speed, maximum speed 5000
  down arrow key  --> -100 speed, minimum speed 10
  right arrow key --> +10  speed, maximum speed 5000
  left arrow key  --> -10  speed, minimum speed 10

  You can decrease the default speed in code
